# Cartesi React Bootstrap Template

SQLite-based full-stack DApp template for React for quick and efficiently develop Cartesi integrated projects.

### Scope and Methodology

The idea is to create a template for create-react-app to facilitate kickstart projects. The template will use the last version of React and integration with Ethers to be able to send inputs to Sepolia Network and receive back notices from Cartesi Machine, that runs an app with a SQLite database. The inputs will be limited to serve as example for different interaction both on frontend and backend.

UML Diagrams related to the project will be created using Google Drawing and will be pasted on this readme markdown.

A demo of the project will be served at Github Pages and will allow any user that navigates to the app interact with SQLite database.

The completion and follow-up of the project would be able to be tracked using Github issues.

### Expected Deliverables

- A Create-React-App Template to be easily initialized with a React Dapp as submodule.
- A React Dapp + Typescript fully integrated with Ethers and cartesi-client.
- A Backend database Dapp managed by Cartesi machine, also running with Typescript.
- The app will also be served on github pages so user can check the demo before develop on top of it.
- Readme with instructions to install, run locally and deploy live to Catesi Machine. Also will have diagrams explaining how app works and how to extend it.

### Milestones and Timeline

- The project should took 2 weeks of work spammed on a range of 2 months starting by the day of grant confirmation.
